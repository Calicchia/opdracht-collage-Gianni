#Do You Read Me

##Do you read me, won't you tell me?
###If you read me, then please believe me, when I say
####Yes I've been waiting, seems like forever
#####I've been waiting, my situation ain't got much better
######Well I've been waiting, the situation don't get much better
*You don't do unto others as you do unto me,
Well, why am I the only one that treats you this way?
Well, you got that something and it's hard to specify,
I can't diagnose that look in your eyes.*
####You don't do unto me, like I know you could 
####Why am I the only one who's misunderstood? 
####Ashes to ashes, and it's dust to dust, 
####Well, if you won't take me then I guess the devil must.
